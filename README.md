To run the entire program locally you need to first clone the entire repository.

Once you have cloned the repository you need to have the latest version on node installed on your computer so you are able to run npm commands.

If node is already installed than in your terminal locate the frontend directory and run 'npm start'. 

Running 'npm start' should start the page on your localhost and connect to the database on your localhost aswell.
