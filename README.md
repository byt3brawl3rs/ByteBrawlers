#Byte Brawlers
If you want to run our project you need to first start by cloning our project into an empty folder.

Once you are done cloning the project you will need to have node.js and npm installed on your software.

If you do not have them installed follow the tutorial on the website: https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac

Once you have them isntalled you should open up your command line and navigate to the root directory.

Once in the root directory type the command 'npm start'.

This command will install all the files you need to run the software.
